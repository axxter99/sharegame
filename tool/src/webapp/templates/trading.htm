  <li><font face="Arial">Participants are credited with an imaginary cash amount of R100 000
    (one hundred thousand rands). This amount will then be used by the participant to purchase
    any number of shares. Should the participant not have sufficient funds to process the
    order then the order will be partially processed.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial">No interest will be accrued on cash standing to the credit of the
    participant. Participants must utilise their cash for investment purposes.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial">Not more than 30% of the current portfolio value (the total of shares
    and cash not utilised) can be held in any one stock after a purchase.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial">Any order rejected due to the 30% ruling will be partially
    accommodated.</font> </li>
