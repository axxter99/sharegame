		<h2 align="left">Industry Research Project: Share Trading</h2>

		<p align="left">You have been given R100 000 to buy shares in
			companies. Use this money to buy the shares you think will increase
			in value in the next weeks. Once you have bought shares, the
			transaction is placed in a database and marked as 'pending'. The
			shares are 'bought' at that day's closing price and your 'bank
			balance' is debited. If you have insufficient money to buy all the
			shares you requested, you will receive the shares you were able to
			afford. You cannot undo any transactions, so check what you fill in
			on the forms. Once you have bought shares and the transaction has
			been processed you can sell them. The money is then credited to your
			bank balance. Consult the links to useful information or click the
			'Start Trading' button below to view your portfolio or buy or sell
			shares.</p>
