		<h2>Procedures and Rules</h2>

		<ol type="a">
			<li>Participants are credited with an imaginary cash amount of
				R100 000 (one hundred thousand rands). This amount will then be used
				by the participant to purchase any number of shares. Should the
				participant not have sufficient funds to process the order then the
				order will be partially processed.</li>
			<li>No interest will be accrued on cash standing to the credit
				of the participant. Participants must utilise their cash for
				investment purposes.</li>
			<li>Not more than 30% of the current portfolio value (the total
				of shares and cash not utilised) can be held in any one stock after
				a purchase.</li>
			<li>Any order rejected due to the 30% ruling will be partially
				accommodated.</li>
		
			<li>All transactions will be executed at the ruling price of
				that day's market. If a transaction is received after the end of
				that day&#146;s trading it will be executed at the next day's ruling
				price. All transactions will be automatically dated.</li>
			<li>Definition of 'ruling price' -
			<blockquote>
				<p>The ruling price is the closing price made available by the
					stock exchange at the end of a trading day.</p>
			</blockquote></li>

			<li>No change in the order may be made after the transaction has
				been executed unless it is dealt with as a separate transaction with
				the resultant broker charges.</li>
			<li>Transactions will be executed on the day of receipt at that
				day's market ruling price.</li>
			<li>Once a transaction is concluded the participant will be
				levied brokerage amounting to 3% of the value of the stock purchased
				or sold, plus the VAT on the brokerage, and Marketable Securities
				Tax (MST) currently 0,25%.</li>
			<li>Broker's confirmation notes will be e-mailed to
				participants&nbsp;daily showing trades executed on the
				previous&nbsp;day as well as information on any rejected orders.</li>
			<li>A portfolio statement containing the participants&#146; cash
				balance and current share value will be available on the Web.</li>
			<li>Participants&nbsp;may query a trade up to 30 calendar days
				after the transaction has taken place. <b>No queries will be
					accepted after this period.</b></li>
			<li>Dividend Payouts will be credited directly to your account
				by the broker.</li>
